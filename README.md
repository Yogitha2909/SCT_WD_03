A Tic Tac Toe web application is a simple interactive browser-based game where two players take turns marking spaces on a 3Ã—3 grid with "X" and "O". The first player to get three of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
